Thank you repl.it for this challenge, it has got me (and I think my team) into develpoing this amazing project.

### So what are you waiting for? [TRY IT NOW!](https://aardvark.programit.repl.run)


### [Documentation:](https://aardvark-website.programit.repl.co/docs/latest)
#### Getting Started:
To get started with your first output do: ``output('hello world!\n')``. There you go, you've officially ran your first program! Take note of the ``\n``. If you (like me) get tired quickly of writing ``\n`` you can go ahead and use ``#include anr`` press enter, and then run ``output('hello world!')``. See! works without the ``\n``. We'll talk more about ``#include`` later, but for now thats all you need to know. Comments start with ``/`` and end with ``\``.

## Running Files
To run files all you need to do is run `#include file-to-run` this imports all aspects of a file and runs them directly to the terminal.

### So there are the basics, now got write your first Aardvark program!
