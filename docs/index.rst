Getting Started:
########
To get started with your first output do: ``output('hello world!\n')``. There you go, you've officially ran your first program! Take note of the ``\n``. If you (like me) get tired quickly of writing ``\n`` you can go ahead and use `#include anr` press enter, and then run ``output('hello world!')``. See! works without the ``\n``. We'll talk more about ``#include`` later, but for now thats all you need to know.

Running Files:
########
To run files all you need to do is run ``#include file-to-run`` this imports all aspects of a file and runs them directly to the terminal.
