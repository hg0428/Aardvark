Thank you for choosing Aardvark!

Getting Started:
To get started with your first output do: `output('hello world!\n')`. There you go, you've officially ran your first program! Take note of the `\n`. If you (like me) get tired quickly of writing `\n` you can go ahead and use `#include anr` press enter, and then run `output('hello world!')`. See! works without the `\n`. We'll talk more about `#include` later, but for now thats all you need to know.

Running Files:
To run files all you need to do is run `#include file-to-run` this imports all aspects of a file and runs them directly to the terminal.
